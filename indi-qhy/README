How to Use
==========

	You can use the QHY INDI Driver in any INDI-compatible client such as KStars or Xephem. 
	
	To run the driver from the command line:
	
	$ indiserver indi_qhy_ccd
	
	You can then connect to the driver from any client, the default port is 7624.
	If you're using KStars, the driver will be automatically listed in KStars' Device Manager,
	no further configuration is necessary.

        If you cannot connect to the INDI driver from any INDI compliant application, run the QHY CCD test:

        $ qhy_ccd_test

        Share the test result output in INDI & QHY forums. Be as thorough as possible with your environment conditions (OS, architecture..etc)
