# Weewx support for Weatherradio
# weewx: http://weewx.com/
# weather radio: https://github.com/indilib/indi-3rdparty/blob/master/indi-duino/doc/Readme-WeatherRadio.md
#
# Driver based on the arduinoPWS driver https://github.com/rkaczorek/arduino-pws
#
# For minimal changes to weatherradio I'm trying to support c v and w commands
# v and c commands are saved on init as a static website. Rather than generating
# w in the driver, instead it's an output generated by weewx which potentially
# allows it to be decorated in the long run by extra information from extensions
# and calculated data.
#
# I've implemented this using using a custom skin report which updates every ARCHIVE
# record
#
# Even better would be to have a version of the weatherradio indi driver that pulls
# its data real-time from weewx every LOOP. This could be implemented as a custom weewx service
# writing out JSON, or by altering the indi driver to read from the output of the generic
# JSON format produced by the service https://github.com/chaunceygardiner/weewx-loopdata
#

To install:

tar cvzf weatherradio.tar.gz weatheradio
sudo wee_extension --install weatherradio.tar.gz
sudo service weewx restart
