This software used various low libraries to access Raspberry Pi GPIO:
* libgpiod - all commits after bc6f898 (after Gordon decided to stop developing WiringPi on August 6, 2019)
* WiringPi only - from commit abd7b3b to bc6f898
* BC2835 and WiringPi - up to commit 3283e99

Rationale behind moving this to libgpiod is that it is part of mainland kernel and it does not depend on
any library other than the standard C library with GNU extensions.
libgpiod is available here: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libgpiod/libgpiod.git
