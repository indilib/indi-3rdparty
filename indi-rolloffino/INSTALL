Some drivers omit or have brief directions: 
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr . ../
sudo make install

When in place in the 3rdparty driver area try that. See what assumptions might be
made for a non-technical user who has only done a standard install.

To build the rolloffino roof driver, development libraries and
3rdparty driver build files are needed. If you do not already have the
current development files installed, see the directions in the web page below.

https://indilib.org/forum/general/210-howto-building-latest-libindi-ekos.html
Section 1 Contains the normal INDI install directions.
Section 2 Install the packages to get the development libraries.
          Perform down to and including the git clone to fetch the INDI source
          tree. Do not do the cmake build unless you want to run your own build
          of INDI.
Section 3 With your default directory set to ~/Projects or whatever you are
          using for a base. If you already have the 3rdparty drivers installed
          that match the version you wish to build against no need to recreate
          them. If their version does not match then delete the existing
          3rdparty tree. 
          Install the packages to get the libraries and then
          perform the git clone. No need to go beyond the clone.

In addition to the libraries already installed, install libindi-dev.

-----------------

Set default to a working directory, for example ~/Projects/work

```
mkdir -p ~/Projects/work
cd ~/Projects/work

```

Clone the github 3rdparty repository.
When cloning you need to obtain source files that match the INDI version you are have installed. For example if you are running the nightly release

```

git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/indilib/indi-3rdparty.git

```
Or if running a stable release, use the -b switch to match the installed stable release tag for the INDI version

```

git clone --depth=1 -b v2.0.1 https://github.com/indilib/indi-3rdparty.git

```
The 3rdparty source tree will now be in your ~/Projects/work directory. Create a build directory for rolloffino and set default there.

```
mkdir ~/Projects/work/indi-rolloffino/build
cd ~/Projects/work/indi-rolloffino/build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../
make
sudo make install 

```
This will build and install the indi_rolloffino roof driver. If it completes
without error the following files can be found.

```
/usr/bin/indi_rolloffino The driver executable          

/usr/share/indi/indi_rolloffino.xml Identifying the roof driver to Ekos.

```
If the xml file is not there see if it is in /usr/local/share/indi/ and copy it to /usr/share/indi/ 
The driver will then be available for selection in the Ekos profile editor Dome section.

When this is done the RollOffino driver should be available for selection under "Domes" In the Ekos profile definition user interface.
