INDI observatory rolloff roof driver for a DIY automation project.

The driver is intended to be installed and used without the need
for coding in the INDI environment. The driver can interface to
an Arduino using USB or WiFi. Several code examples of Arduino
code are provided for modification to define Relay and pin
assignments.

If the driver is running on a Raspberry Pi and a direct wired
connection to a roof controller is viable, the INDI driver can
conditionally be built to use the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins directly.

Additional information is in the html/rolloffino.html and
html/rpi-gpio-note.html files.
