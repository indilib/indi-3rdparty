Modified Nov 3, 2021 to be more explicit.

To build the rolloffino roof driver, development libraries and
3rdparty driver build files are needed. If you do not already have the
current development files installed, see the directions in the web page below.

https://indilib.org/forum/general/210-howto-building-latest-libindi-ekos.html
Section 1 Contains the normal INDI install directions.
Section 2 Install the packages to get the development libraries.
          Perform down to and including the git clone to fetch the INDI source
          tree. Do not do the cmake build unless you want to run your own build
          of INDI.
Section 3 With your default directory set to ~/Projects or whatever you are
          using for a base. If you already have the 3rdparty drivers installed
          that match the version you wish to build against no need to recreate
          them. If their version does not match then delete the existing
          3rdparty tree. 
          Install the packages to get the libraries and then
          perform the git clone. No need to go beyond the clone.

In addition to the libraries already installed, install libindi-dev.

There should now be two subdirectories of ~/Projects indi and the indi-3rdparty
tree of drivers. These directories should be from the same version of INDI
and match the version you are running.

$ cd ~/Projects/indi-3rdparty
$ git clone https://github.com/wotalota/indi-rolloffino.git

This obtains the rolloffino sources and puts them in
~/Projects/indi-3rdparty/indi-rolloffino
Make a directory below this and set it as your default in which to do the build.

$ mkdir indi-rolloffino/build
$ cd indi-rolloffino/build

Before running the cmake command. Confirm that the following is true.
- Within the ~/Projects there are 2 sub directories  that have been populated "indi" and "indi_3rdparty".
- In ~/Project/indi_3rdparty/indi-rolloffino/ are the files from the wotalota github.
- Your present default directory is ~/Project/indi_3rdparty/indi-rolloffino/build

$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install 

This will build and install the indi_rolloffino roof driver. If it completes
without error the following files can be found.
- /usr/bin/indi_rolloffino The driver executable          
- /usr/share/indi/indi_rolloffino.xml Identifying the roof driver to Ekos. 
The driver will then be available for selection in the Ekos profile editor 
Dome section.
