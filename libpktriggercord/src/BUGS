Known bugs of pkTriggerCord
============================

General
-------

  Setting jpeg sharpness/contrast/saturation has no effect sometimes.

  Downloading jpeg with non-maximal resolution does not work.

  Taking picture restores jpeg image tone, so jpeg image tone setting
  is quite useless.

  Setting exposure mode has no effect ( maybe it's not a bug only it's
  not allowed ).

  ISO table of GUI only shows the extended iso range even is base iso
  range is set.

  The program stops for approx. 20 minutes after 4-5 hours
  (e.g. --frames 200 --delay 120)

  --select_af_point Auto-11 changes to Auto-5 instead

  Top LCD panel is flashing
  
  Green button does not work for newer cameras. It does nothing.
