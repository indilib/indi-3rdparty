- Make sure indi_rpicam does not break building whole indi_3rdparty
- raw10-decoders needs to move up high-bits to bit15 in image buffer.
- Try using encoding MMAL_ENCODING_BAYER_SBGGR12P if that works and is even faster.
- Don't start from x=0 on subframes..
- Exposure time does not seem to affect exposure now. printf(stderr from mmalcamera does not get output anywhere.
- Speed improved from 40s to about 7s but only one exposure works.
