NOTES :

	Temporary file, until the first release. We will then use github issues

------------------ TO DO

- TEST 0 : test on x86 (32bits)
- FIX 8 : experienced a frame timeout 2 times during my tests
	* driver stalled after that
- FIX 9 : have to toggle ekos "bayer" to see live view
- FIX 10 : streaming / live view slow start

------------------ DONE

- FIX 0 : bayer pattern
- FIX 1 : same image sent twice after 2 exposures
- FIX 2 : Exposure abort : crash at next capture
- FIX 3 : frame looping also crashs at 2nd frame
	* FIX 1, 2, 3 : camera dislike pause/play sequences
        * "abort exposure" capability disabled for the moment
- FIX 4 : is "auto" analog gain still enabled ?
	* no, it's OK
- TRY 0 : use camera trigger instead of continuous mode
	* triggered framing avoids heat excess
- FEATURE 0 : find a way to "abort" exposure
        * we can abort exposure using trigger mode switching
- FIX 5 : add timeout in TimeHit loop
- FIX 6 : after trigger mode switch, we got a junk frame
	* we read this junk frame after each trigger mode switch, and drop it
- FIX 7 : junck frames after gain change
	* cf. FIX 6
- FEATURE 1 : add gain control
- FEATURE 2 : add ROI
	* now way to get SDK's ROI features working
        * does'nt accept anything else than the native resolution
        * we use software subframing
- FEATURE 3 : add binning
        * no way to use native camera binning (cf. FEATURE 2)
        * basic software binning done
        * remove bayer pattern ?
- FEATURE 4 : add streaming (live view)
- CLEAN : log levels
- CLEAN : comments
